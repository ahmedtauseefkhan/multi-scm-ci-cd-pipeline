# multi-scm-ci-cd-pipeline

This repository will contain a Jenkins pipeline configuration for setting up a complete CI/CD process with multiple SCM integrations. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Checkout Code from Multiple Repositories**:
   - We will configure Jenkins to pull source code from two separate Git repositories (`repo-service-a` and `repo-service-b`).
   
2. **SonarQube Code Scan**:
   - After checking out the code, we will pass it through SonarQube for static code analysis and quality checks.
   
3. **Build with Docker**:
   - The code will be built and packaged into Docker containers for deployment.

4. **Deploy to Remote Location**:
   - The Docker images will be deployed to a remote server, such as a production or staging environment.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Upon completion (whether success or failure), Jenkins will send an email and webhook notification to inform stakeholders of the result.

This repository will hold the necessary files for setting up this Jenkins pipeline, such as the `Jenkinsfile`, Dockerfile, and any supporting scripts.
